# Requesting a quota increase

With **Service Quotas**, you can view and manage your quotas for AWS services from a central location. Quotas, also referred to as limits in AWS services, are the maximum values for the resources, actions, and items in your AWS account. Each AWS service defines its quotas and establishes default values for those quotas. Depending on your business needs, you might need to increase your service quota values. **Service Quotas** enables you to look up your service quotas and to request increases. AWS Support might approve, deny, or partially approve your requests.
